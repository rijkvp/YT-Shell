# YT-Shell

YT-Shell is a browser extension that helps you stay focused while browsing YouTube. The extension ensures that you are not distracted with the aim of spending your time on 'quality content'. It works by injecting CSS and JS that hide things from the site. There are settings for blocking stuff including blocking recommendations, hiding upcummies and thumbnails.

## Installation
The extension is currently only available in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store because I don't want to pay for the registration fees for the Chrome Web Store.

### Microsoft Edge
[__Get from Microsoft Edge Add-ons store__](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ytshell/dicfaohifjibflnmnbokaeoakkdlkaij)

### Manual installation
1. Download and unzip the [latest release](https://github.com/rijkvp/YT-Shell/releases) from GitHub or clone the repository. 
2. Make sure developer mode is enabled in your browser. On most chromium browsers there's a switch on the extensions page where you can enable it.
3. Press 'load unpacked' and select the extension folder to load and enable it.
