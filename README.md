# YT-Shell

YT-Shell is a browser extension that helps you stay focused while browsing YouTube. The extension ensures that you are not distracted with the aim of spending your time on 'quality content'. It works by injecting CSS and JS that hide things from the site. There are settings for blocking stuff including blocking recommendations, hiding upcummies and thumbnails.

## Installation
The extension is currently only available in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store because I don't want to pay for the registration fees for the Chrome Web Store.

### Microsoft Edge

### Manual installation
1. Download and unzip the [latest release](https://github.com/rijkvp/YT-Shell/releases) from GitHub or clone the repository. 
2. Make sure developer mode is enabled in your browser. On most chromium browsers there's a switch on the extensions page where you can enable it.
3. Press 'load unpacked' and select the extension folder to load and enable it.

## Features

### Blocking recommendations

Recommendations are the main reason the YouTube-algorithm makes you keep watching more and more. While the algoritm can sometimes do a great job of recommendating videos you might like, most of the time the videos are really distracting and aren't really what you're looking for. Recommendations can sometimes even be [harmful](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/regrets-reporter/findings/). This option blocks recommendations in all parts of the website.

There's also an option for blocking 'explore' feeds like the trending or gaming pages wich can be distracting sometimes.

### Hiding notifications

One of the simplest steps to avoid getting distracted is to disable notifications. This option will hide the notification panel and all of the notification-bells next to the subscibe button. 

### Hiding upcummies

Upcummies, on YouTube subsciber and (dis)like counts, are the things that make social media so addicting. 
People are constantly looking how much subscribers or likes they got like you can represend everything by a number thats actually meaningless. This option will completely hide the upcummies on YouTube. 

### Hiding thumbnails & avatars

Thumbnails can be very disturbing and misleading due to a phenomenon called 'clickbait'. These days, there are hardly any videos on YouTube that don't have a clickbaity thumbnail. By simply hiding those thumbnails and only showing the title of the video (wich unfortunately can also be clickbaity) you'll may find yourself less distracted. Additionally you can hide avatars as well.
